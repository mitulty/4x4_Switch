To clean and start from the beginning run the script "clean.sh"
The script "debug.sh" compiles all the source codes and the testbench. It also generates all the required executable files.
Then run 
	./bin/testbench_aa2c
to verify using the C Testbench

To do the VHDL Simulation run 
	./bin/testbench_vhdl 
in one terminal and
	./ahir_system_test_bench --stop-time=15000ns --wave=run.ghw
	in the other terminal
This generates a dumped wave file which can be viewed using the GTKWave Viewer using the command
	gtkwave run.ghw

Following things are already done while running build.sh script but for can be run separetly too.
To build the Aa->C model run the script "compile.sh" present in the hw folder. To clean the generated files run the script "remove.sh" in the same folder.
To build the Aa->C Testbench run the script "build_aa2c.sh"
